# Dimensionality-reduction-for-Customer-churn-datasets

For three publicly available datasets (Kaggle) , the dimensionality reduction algorithm UMAP and Featured-type distributed clutering(FDC), which was proposed in https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666827023000439 are compared and analysed. A supervised dimension reduction is also done using supervised UMAP and supervised FDC algorithms.

The datasets used are Bank Customer Churn dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravtopre/bank-customer-churn-dataset), Churn in Telecom's dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/becksddf/churn-in-telecoms-dataset/data) and Telco Customer Churn (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).
